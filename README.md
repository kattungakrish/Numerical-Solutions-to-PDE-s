# Numerical-Solutions-to-PDE-s
-We had to model solutions to the 1D Heat Equation and finally make contour plots of the solutions.

-This is done by converting the differential equation into a finite difference problem.
 Three such models were implemented in our project:
 1. Forward Euler Method (FTCS)
 2. Richardson Method
 3. DuFort-Frankel Method

-The solution was initialized and plotted using 2D arrays. (handled by the "numpy" module)
-Plotting was done using the "matplotlib" module.
